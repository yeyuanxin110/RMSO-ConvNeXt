# RMSO-ConvNeXt
This is an implementation of our paper: RMSO-ConvNeXt: A Lightweight CNN Network for Robust SAR and Optical Image Matching under Strong Noise Interference.

The main file is demo.py, which inputs the image pairs and outputs the matching result.

The model and code will be uploaded later.

We have published an optical and SAR image data set named GEGF_SOdataset on https://pan.baidu.com/s/1C_6ei101CMhHlOtKgjVTxQ?pwd=hae0.

Some *. py files in tools are encrypted as *. pyd files, which can be normally invoked in Python 3.8 and Win 64 environments.

Any question pls contact: yc18483685462@163.com
