# RMSO-ConvNeXt
This is an implementation of our paper: RMSO-ConvNeXt: A Lightweight CNN Network for Robust SAR and Optical Image Matching under Strong Noise Interference.

The main file is demo.py, which inputs the image pairs and outputs the matching result.

Some *. py files in tools are encrypted as *. pyd files, which can be normally invoked in Python 3.8 and Win 64 environments.
